Empowering Users to Take Charge of Their Health


 Overview
The BMI Calculator is a sleek and reliable Android application that calculates Body Mass Index (BMI) based on user-provided height and weight. It categorizes the BMI value into distinct health ranges, empowering users to better understand their fitness levels. The app features an engaging user interface, efficient calculations, and adherence to modern Android development practices.
This project showcases my proficiency in Android development, focusing on Kotlin programming, Material Design principles, and scalable app architecture. It also demonstrates my ability to combine functional design with precise implementation to create an exceptional user experience.
